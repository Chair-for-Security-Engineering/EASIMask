# EASIMask - Towards Efficient, Automated, and Secure Implementation of Masking in Hardware

This repository contains the source code for the paper [*EASIMask - Towards Efficient, Automated, and Secure Implementation of Masking in Hardware*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10137330).

## 1. Features
EASIMask is an extension to the open-source hardware construction language [*SpinalHDL*](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/SpinalHDL) that allows to semi-automatically apply side-channel countermeasures to cryptographic circuits.

## 2. Contact
Please contact Fabian Buschkowski (*fabian.buschkowski@rub.de*) if you have any questions, comments, found a bug that needs to be corrected, or want to reuse the tool or parts of it for your own research.

## 3. Build Instructions
In order to run the tool, you will need a working installation of [*Scala 2*](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and [*sbt*](https://www.scala-sbt.org/). You can then clone this repository and should be ready to go.
